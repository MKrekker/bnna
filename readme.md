# BNN Accelerator
* **Instead of using floating-point or integer numbers, BNN uses just one Bit('0' or '1')**
* **Fantastic opportunity for the realization of compact and energy efficient inference hardware**
* **The binary representation can be multiplied quickly and easily**
* **Disadvantage of BNN  it is less accurate**
